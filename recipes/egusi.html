    <h1>Egusi soup</h1>

    <img src="../images/egusi.jpeg" alt="garnished eusi">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ground melon</li>
    <li>smoked turkey</li>
    <li>smoked mackerel</li>
    <li>beef stock cubes</li>
    <li>nigeria pepper mix</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>dried prawns</li>
    <li>Iru woro or pete (locust beans): substitute with ogiri or omit if you do not have it</li>
    <li>palm oil</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Add ground melon to a bowl, add about a cup of water and mix to form a paste then set aside. Wash and chop the spinach, drain in a colander and set aside.</li>
    <li>Place a big pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 3 minutes (Do not bleach oil) add the reserved chopped onions and Sautee till translucent</li>
    <li>Add pepper mix, locust beans and stir to combine. Bring to boil for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the egusi paste in bits to pepper, reduce the heat, do not stir and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the lid, and gently stir the soup. The egusi would be lumpy at this point, use the back of a ladle to break the lumps it into desired size/texture</li>
    <li>Add smoked turkey, ground crayfish and crayfish, beef stock (if using) and stir to combine. Add bouillon cubes, taste and adjust accordingly. I didnâ€™t add salt to this soup as the smoked turkey and mackerel already contained salt. Continue to cook for another 10 minutes, check at intervals and stir to avoid burning if need be</li>
    <li>Add shredded smoked mackerel and gently stir into the soup. Add chopped spinach, stir to combine and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Take it off the heat, allow to cool for about 10 minutes before serving</li>
    
</ol>
    <p>Serve and enjoy with any Nigerian swallow of choice, you can even serve over white rice. Not afraid to</p>
